    # We always update prod deployments to the "latest" container tag. GitHub actions do start in the order of merged
    # commits, but there is no guarantee on docker execution time, We could have a situation where two commits are
    # merged at the ~same time, but the earlier commit finishes building later than the most recent one, which in turn
    # means that the "latest" tag won't point to the latest commit.
    #
    # There is no builtin way to make one action run at a time, so we use Turnstyle.
