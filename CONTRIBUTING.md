# Contributing
Hi! 

Thank you for your interest in the WarsawLO project!
We, the maintainers, believe that tools like this one should be crafted by a community.

We hope that this guide will help you find your way of participating.
If this document does not answer your questions, feel free to reach us.

## How can I contribute? :bulb:

### Report bugs :bug:
If you notice a bug, check if it hasn't been already reported and if not please file an issue.

If you are not a technical person or don't want to use GitHub to report a bug, please contact us via email.

### Code :computer:
> We assume you have a basic understanding of how git & GitHub work.
> If you are not comfortable with GitHub workflow [this guide](https://github.com/firstcontributions/first-contributions) may be helpful. Check it out and come back to us later :slightly_smiling_face:

We try to hold all code/features-related discussions in issues sections of corresponding repositories ([warsawlo-2.0](https://github.com/WarsawLO/warsawlo-2.0) for front-end or [warsawlo-django](https://github.com/WarsawLO/warsawlo-django) for back-end).
Just browse the issues and let us know in a comment that you want to handle it. We'll assign you to that issue.

Please keep in mind when contributing:
* Please first discuss the change you wish to make by commenting on a related issue unless it is assigned to you.
* All pull requests need to be reviewed by at least one maintainer.
* If you make changes to things described in [README](README.md) or this file, remember to update the docs accordingly.
* Please make sure there are no linted/formatted files out of the scope of your work

One more thing - don't hesitate to start your commit message with applicable [gitmoji](https://gitmoji.carloscuesta.me/). :slightly_smiling_face:

### Spread the news :loudspeaker:

### Join our team :wave:
Currently, we are looking for:

Do you think one of those rules is for you? Drop us a line!

### I want to contribute in some other way :sparkles:
We couldn't be more thrilled! Write to us, and we'll try to figure out something together.
